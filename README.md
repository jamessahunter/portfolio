This project was made for me to show the work I've done as a Full Stack Developer. This project was also used to better learn the flexbox system the can be used in CSS. Also this taught me how to make images link to a website. This project also took advantage of variables in CSS to reduce the clutter in the file and make and changes to the themeing easier.
