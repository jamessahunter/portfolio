[Visit the Deployed Site] (https://jamessahunter.github.io/portfolio/)

This project was made for me to show the work I've done as a Full Stack Developer. This project was also used to better learn the flexbox system the can be used in CSS. The flexbox system is useflul in creating and laying out a website and the various sections on the website. Also this taught me how to make images link to a website. This project also taught me about how to create and adaptive screen layout using media query. This project also took advantage of variables in CSS to reduce the clutter in the file and make and changes to the themeing easier. 

# Usage

 The website should load and scroll up and down. The links in the header take you to the correct sections. 

 An example of how the website should perform is in the gif below.
